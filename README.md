# MadridTourGuideApp

App utilizes multiple ArrayLists and Adapters in order to centralize methodology for display of multiple activity lists.

App features home page that allows user to select from 4 lists to view:

  - Events
  - Historical Sites
  - Hotels
  - Restaurants
  
User can view information from the 4 lists to assist them with their visit to Madrid, Spain. 

App is designed to allow much more integration and scaling, including location services, data fetching from APIs and other 
sources, Multi-language support, and more to create a one-app solution for the tourist visiting Madrid.

Application designed in full by Kyle Richard(myself). My written approval is needed for any and all use of this application
for commercial purposes.
